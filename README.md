# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal bootstrap portfolio with all the projects I have recently worked on and will be working on. It will be updated throughout my individual learning experience.

I have always had a nack for coding and decided to take the leap into learning different web development techniques and projects. My current first project is search engine optimisations (SEO) which you can view by accessing the delopyed link of this repo.

You can also see my previous portfolio which had no bootstrap included. I also mentioned my cheat sheet which has some information on how to do HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. 

## Usage

## Credits

I utilised Bootstrap in order to achieve this outcome. My personalised touch was added through my CSS style sheet but the majority has been taken from the bootstrap documentation.
